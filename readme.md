- Open `Terminal`
- `cd` to the directory that contains the built _environment_.

```
cd \d <path>
Ex : cd \d G:/GitRepository/Machine-Learning/
```
- Acitvate _Anaconda Environment_ simply by typing : `$ conda activate [environmentName]`
  - If you don't specifictly name the `[environmentName]` name , it will automatically open the base environment.
